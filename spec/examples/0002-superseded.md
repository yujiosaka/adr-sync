# 2. Superseded

Date: 2024-09-02

## Status

Superseded by [3. Accepted supersedes](0003-accepted-supersedes.md)

## Context

The Redis-based caching system has shown performance limitations in handling highly dynamic data.

## Decision

We will switch from Redis to a NoSQL-based caching system that provides better support for dynamic data.

## Consequences

This transition will involve a significant migration effort and potential downtime but will ultimately provide better scalability.
