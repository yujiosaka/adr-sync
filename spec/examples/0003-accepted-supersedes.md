Supercedes [2. Superseded](0002-superseded.md)

## Context

NoSQL databases offer a scalable solution for caching dynamic data in real-time, which Redis couldn't handle efficiently.

## Decision

We will implement NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB or Couchbase, to improve performance for real-time dynamic data.

## Consequences

This migration will enhance scalability but may increase operational costs due to the complexity of managing NoSQL systems.
