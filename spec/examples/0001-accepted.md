Accepted

## Context

To improve the performance of API responses, especially for read-heavy workloads, we will implement caching.

## Decision

We will introduce a Redis-based caching layer to store frequently requested data, reducing load times.

## Consequences

This will add complexity to our infrastructure and will require careful cache invalidation strategies.
